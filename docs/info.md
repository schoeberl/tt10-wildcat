## How it works

It is an educational RISC-V core.
This tapeout contains the bare minimum: an assembler coded *blinking* LED
(In fact it counts up and displays the value on the 7-segment display).

## How to test

Just let it run and see the 7-segment display counting up.

## External hardware

None
